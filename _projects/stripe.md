No! Look away! I'm making an egg, Mom! Ugh…! I'm making an egg! I'm Scary Terry!! You can run but you can't hide, bitch! Crystal poachers. There's no lower form of life. They think the galaxy's their own personal piggy bank. Oh my god, how could I not see this coming? My lust, my greed! I deserve thiiiiii- Ladies, let's get out of here. I haven't learned a thiiiiiing!

There's a lesson here and I'm not going to be the one to figure it out. Why'd you even rope me into this?! You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel? Ooohhh can do.

That's an intense line of questioning, Snuffles You're not gonna believe this, because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake. Wow, so your origin is what? You fell into a vat of redundancy?

I mean, why would a poptart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean? Rubber baby buggy bumpers! You're growing up fast, Morty. You're going into a great big thorn straight into my ass
